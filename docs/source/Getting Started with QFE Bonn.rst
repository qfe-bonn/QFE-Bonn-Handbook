Welcome to QFE Bonn!  
We've carefully designed the onboarding process to be **beginner-friendly and accessible** to students from all backgrounds.

This page will walk you through the steps to get started, the resources we provide, and what we expect from you as a member.

Step-by-Step for New Joiners
----------------------------

**1. Join a Session**
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Attend one of our **bi-weekly project session** or a **monthly public workshop**.  
This is the best way to:

* Meet our team leads and current members.

* See how project sessions are conducted.

* Get a sense of the collaborative and supportive club culture.

**2. Choose a Team**
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

We have three core project teams:

* **Economics Team**: Macroeconomic Forecasting, Policy Analysis, Labor Markets, etc.

* **Finance Team**: Portfolio Management, Trading Strategies, Financial Risk Modeling, etc.

* **Quant Team**: Machine Learning, Data Science, Algorithm Development, etc.

‚û°Ô∏è You'll select a team based on your interest, and then select a project group working on an ongoing topic
or start your own project group to work on a new topic.

**3. Set Up Your Tools**
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You'll need some essential tools:

* **Python environment:** Install Jupyter Notebooks or Anaconda.
* **GitHub account:** For code sharing and collaboration.
* **Code editor:** VS Code is recommended, but alternatives are welcome.

We **do not provide setup tutorials directly**, but **you can always ask your team leaders or current members** for help setting up your environment.

**4. Begin Your Learning Pathway**
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Now that you've joined a team and set up your tools, it's time to start learning!  
Your next step is to **move directly to the Beginner Pipeline section below on this same page.**

There, you'll find:
- A step-by-step learning path for Python and data science basics.
- Free beginner-friendly courses and recommended resources.
- QFE Bonn's custom beginner and intermediate notebooks.

This pipeline will help you build the essential skills you need to contribute confidently to your team's projects.

üëâ **Scroll to the next section now to begin your learning journey.**

Beginner Pipeline
-----------------

To help new members start learning immediately, we provide a **Beginner Pipeline** with step-by-step learning recommendations.  
You can skip any part if you already have experience in that area.

Python is our main programming language because it is widely used in data science, finance, and economics and is beginner-friendly.  
If you wish to explore other languages, visit the **Coding Category** on the **Resource Page** of our website for additional resources, including materials on **R** and **MATLAB**.
