Our Pledge
----------

We as members, and leaders pledge to make participation in our community a harassment-free experience for everyone,
regardless of age, body size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression,
level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, caste, color, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

We pledge to act and interact in ways that contribute to an open, welcoming, diverse, inclusive, and healthy community.

Our Standards
-------------

Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment for our community include:

* **Be friendly and patient.** Demonstrating empathy and kindness toward other people.

* **Be respectful.** Not all of us will agree all the time, but disagreement is no excuse for poor behavior and poor manners. Being respectful of differing opinions, viewpoints, and experiences.

* **Be welcoming** We strive to be a community that welcomes and supports people of all backgrounds and identities.

* **Be responsible.** Accepting responsibility and apologizing to those affected by our mistakes, and learning from the experience.

* **Be considerate.** Focusing on what is best not just for us as individuals, but for the overall community. Remember that we're all in this together.

* **Be nice.** Gracefully give and accept constructive feedback. Different people have different perspectives on issues. Being unable to understand why someone holds a viewpoint doesn't mean that they're wrong.

Examples of unacceptable behavior include:

* **Be careful in the words that you choose.** This includes, but is not limited to:

   * The use of sexualized language or imagery, and sexual attention or advances of any kind.

   * Violent threats or language directed against another person.

   * Discriminatory jokes or language, and personal or political attacks.

   * Posting or threatening to post other people's private information, such as a physical or email address, without their explicit permission.

   * Personal insults, especially those using racist or sexist terms.

   * Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting.

   * Advocating for, or encouraging, any of the above behavior.

   * Repeated harassment of others. In general, if someone asks you to stop, then stop.

Enforcement Responsibilities
----------------------------

Community leaders are responsible for clarifying and enforcing our standards of acceptable behavior and will take appropriate
and fair corrective action in response to any behavior that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

Community leaders have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues,
and other contributions that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct, and will communicate reasons for moderation decisions when appropriate.

Scope
-----

This Code of Conduct applies within all community spaces, and also applies when an individual is officially representing the community in public spaces.
Examples of representing our community include using an official email address, posting via an official social media account,
or acting as an appointed representative at an online or offline event.

Enforcement
-----------

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported to the community leaders.
All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly.

All community leaders are obligated to respect the privacy and security of the reporter of any incident.
If you believe someone is violating the code of conduct, we ask that you report it by emailing `qfe.bonn@gmail.com`_ with as much detail as possible.

**1. Correction**
